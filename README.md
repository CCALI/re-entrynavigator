LITCon 2019 Hackathon project

This hackathon project is two-fold. We created an A2J Guided Interview for people re-entering the community after being incarcerated. It produces potentially three documents for the end user: a verification of employment form, a substance abuse recovery meetings verification form, and a "Personalized Action Plan" that contains resources for finding affordable housing, employment, and drug testing facilities depending on what the user selects as needed help. This is currently hosted on www.a2j.org for public testing and use. To run the Re-Entry Navigator A2J Guided Interview, including the ability to save your answers and come back again, please use this URL: https://www.a2j.org/guide/go/1ab639bb-30ec-4ac2-b744-440496b410c4

The second part of the hackathon project was to add the ability to A2J Guided Interviews for users to receive text messaged reminders and/or emailed calendar invitations of their upcoming parole officer check-ins. The user can opt-in to this feature, it's not automatically triggered by the interview. The email component is not finished.  Emails are sent but may be filtered out by spam filters and no calendar is currently attached, however, the text messaging part is stable. To test these new features out, please use this URL: https://viewerdev.a2jauthor.org/hackathon/a2j-viewer/viewer/viewer.html?templateURL=../guides/5caa68a4031f0-hackathon-2019-reentry-navigator-a2j-guided-interview-4/Guide.xml&fileDataURL=../guides/5caa68a4031f0-hackathon-2019-reentry-navigator-a2j-guided-interview-4/&setDataURL=./hackathon-sms.php

If you are interested in working on this A2J Guided Interview for your own project, you can download the zipped interview file and upload it to your own account on www.a2jauthor.org (under the Author tab is where you create an "Authoring" account and where you can log in to the software once you have an account). If you have any issues creating an account or accessing your account, reach out to webmaster@a2jauthor.org

To host this A2J Guided Interview, you will need the A2J Viewer and the A2J Document Assembly Tool. These are both available for free to anyone creating projects for self-represented litigants.
